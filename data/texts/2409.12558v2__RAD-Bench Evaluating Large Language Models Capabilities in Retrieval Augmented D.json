These approaches\noften come with multi-turn dialogue, where\neach interaction is enriched by relevant infor-\nmation retrieved from external sources. Exist-\ning benchmarks either assess LLMs\u2019 chat abil-\nities in multi-turn dialogues or their use of re-\ntrieval for augmented responses in limited tasks\nsuch as knowledge QA or numeric reasoning.\nTo address this gap, we introduce RAD-Bench\n(Retrieval Augmented Dialogue), a comprehen-\nsive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs\u2019\ncapabilities in multi-turn dialogues following\nretrievals. RAD-Bench evaluates two key abili-\nties of LLMs: Retrieval Synthesis and Retrieval\nReasoning over 6 representative scenarios, con-\ncluded from analysis of real-world tasks. By\nemploying discriminative questions, retrieved\ncontexts, and reference answers, our evalua-\ntion of prevalent LLMs reveals performance\ndegradation as additional layers of conditions\nor constraints are applied across conversation\nturns, even when accurate retrieved contexts\nare provided.\nThe data and code are avail-\nable at https://github.com/mtkresearch/\nRAD-Bench\n1\nIntroduction\nIn recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs)\nhave demonstrated exceptional language under-\nstanding ability and have been applied across vari-\nous industries, serving as assistants in fields such as\nacademia, customer support, and research.

Dialogue and chat benchmarks typically\ncover the following key tasks: Knowledge QA, involving factual question answering with factoids embedded in\nprovided context; Knowledge Summarization, requiring summarizing a context according to instructions; Chain\nof Reasoning, centering on arithmetic reasoning with factoids resting within a context; and Planning, involving\nfollowing instructions to make plans using context with graph data structure. In RAD-Bench, scenarios in Retrieval\nSynthesis covers Knowledge QA and Knowledge summarization, while that in Retrieval Reasoning includes\nKnowledge QA, Chain of Reasoning, and Planning.\ntions, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive\nbenchmark that evaluates their ability to effectively\nutilize provided context.\nExisting benchmarks for evaluating LLMs\u2019 aug-\nmented generation following retrieved context,\nsuch as Lyu et al. (2024), Chen et al. (2024),\nYang et al. (2024), Xie et al. (2024), and Zheng\net al. (2024), focus on single-turn instructions,\nwhereas real-world interactions involve multi-turn\ndialogues. Meanwhile, benchmarks in evaluating\nLLMs\u2019 chat capabilities in multi-turn dialogues,\nsuch as Finch et al. (2022), Zheng et al. (2023),\nand Bai et al. (2024), neglect instruction-following\nwith retrieved context. While goal-oriented dia-\nlogue research (Dinan et al., 2019; Feng et al.,\n2021) addresses multi-turn interactions with re-\ntrieved context, it often emphasizes factual ground-\ning over comprehensive context generation quality\nfor evolving queries in typical real-world scenarios\nsuch as writing, summarizing, and planning.\nTo address the aforementioned gap, we propose\nRetrieval Augmented Dialogue Benchmark (RAD-\nBench), a benchmark designed to measure LLMs\u2019\nability to follow user instructions in multi-turn dia-\nlogue scenarios and effectively recall and utilize re-\ntrieved context to enhance their responses. Specifi-\ncally, as shown in Figure 1, each benchmark sample\nconsists of three-turn questions with accompanied\nretrieved context at each turn. RAD-Bench eval-\nuates two key abilities of LLMs in multi-turn dia-\nlogues: Retrieval Synthesis and Retrieval Reason-\ning. These abilities are assessed through scenarios\ncurated from real-world dialogue data (Dom Eccle-\nston, 2024; MediaTek, 2024). Retrieval Synthesis\nmeasures an LLM\u2019s ability to progressively inte-\ngrate retrieved context for tasks like summarization\nand article writing, enabling effective knowledge\naccumulation and synthesis. Retrieval Reasoning\nevaluates whether LLM can make reasonable infer-\nence when user intent changes or additional condi-\ntions are introduced across turns, utilizing context\nin each turn to refine and improve responses. For\neach ability, we select three representative scenar-\nios that exemplify multi-turn dialogues following\nretrievals. To construct RAD-Bench, we developed\na pipeline leveraging multiple LLMs to generate,\nselect, and synthesize questions and retrieved con-\ntexts, ensuring diverse, relevant, and high-quality\nbenchmark samples through automated scoring and\nmanual inspection. In total, RAD-Bench comprises\n89 multi-turn question samples, each consisting of\n3 turns with accompanying retrieved context and\nreference answer. This results in a total of 267 turns\nfor evaluation.\nTo evaluate RAD-Bench, we employ the LLM-\nas-a-Judge framework (Zheng et al., 2023), us-\ning scenario-specific criteria inspired by Fu et al.\n(2023) as scoring guidelines. Our analysis includes\nboth 4 closed-source and 8 open-source LLMs\ncommonly used in industry. Results indicate a\ndecline in model performance when new intents\nor conditions are introduced into multi-turn instruc-\ntions, even when relevant retrieved contexts are pro-\nvided. Additionally, by comparing the evaluation\nscores with Elo ratings from Chatbot Arena (Hard\nPrompts) (Li et al., 2024a; Chiang et al., 2024; Li\net al., 2024b), we demonstrate that RAD-Bench ef-\nfectively differentiates LLMs in context-rich, aug-\nmented dialogue applications. This comparison\nreveals that models with similar performance in\n\nFigure 2: Correlation between RAD-Bench and Chat-\nbot Arena (Hard-En prompts) (Chiang et al., 2024).\nModels exhibiting similar level of multi-turn chat capa-\nbility do not perform similarly when they are applied to\ndialogues from retrieval, as showcased by results from\nLlama3.1-8B vs Mistral-Large; from Llama3.1-70B\nvs Deepseek-V2; from Llama3.1-405B vs GPT-4o. We\nsurmise that the discrepancy could be reduced through\nincluding RAFT (Zhang et al., 2024) in post-trainings,\naligning model behaviors closer to the scenarios in re-\ntrieval augmented dialogue.\nstandard multi-turn conversations may not maintain\nthat performance in retrieval-augmented dialogues.\n2\nRelated Work\nRetrieval Augmented Generation Benchmarks\nSeveral research efforts have evaluated LLMs\u2019 aug-\nmented generation ability with retrieved context.\nFor instance, Lyu et al. (2024) evaluates RAG appli-\ncations in Create, Read, Update, and Delete\nscenarios, while Chen et al. (2024) measures the\nfundamental abilities of LLMs required for RAG.\nAdditionally, Yang et al. (2024) comprehensively\nevaluate factual questions with context from docu-\nments, web searches, APIs, and knowledge graphs.\nContexts from tools such as Google Calendar and\nFlightSearch are provided by Xie et al. (2024)\nand Zheng et al. (2024) to LLMs for evaluating\nplanning abilities. These benchmarks, though, eval-\nuate LLMs in single-turn instructions, whereas\nreal-world applications often involve multi-turn\ndialogues to address accumulation of hypotheses,\nconstraints, and evolving user intents, which are\nnot captured in typical single-turn evaluations.\nContext Grounded Dialogue Benchmarks\nTo evaluate LLMs\u2019 ability to accurately adhere to\ninstructions in multi-turn dialogues grounded on\ncontext in open-ended tasks, several benchmarks\nhave been proposed.\nEarly work in document-\ngrounded dialogue by Dinan et al. (2019); Feng\net al. (2021) asses conversation agents\u2019 capability\nto utilize context from documents for answering\nfactual questions. Work by Chen et al. (2022) ex-\nplores the chain of numerical reasoning of LLMs\nin conversational question answering on financial\nreports. Notably, Qu et al. (2020) benchmarks the\nretrieved passages for multi-turn questions but miss\nthe nuance in benchmarking engagement or under-\nstandability (Fu et al., 2023) of the generated text.\nThese existing work are primarily focused on multi-\nturn factual inquiries or numerical arithmetic tasks\nfor evaluating conversational LLMs.\nFurthermore, recent work by Zheng et al. (2023)\nevaluates models across core abilities such as writ-\ning, extraction, and reasoning with LLM-as-a-\nJudge, while Bai et al. (2024) proposes fine-grained\nassessments of real-life dialogues. Dubois et al.\n(2024a) and Lin et al. (2024) comprehensively eval-\nuate models with human-chatbot conversation logs,\nthough these are limited to single-turn instructions.\nWhile these studies address the effectiveness of\nLLMs in complex tasks like knowledge synthesis,\nsummarization, planning, and reasoning, they often\noverlook the aspect of context retrieval, which is\ncrucial for applications rich in contextual informa-\ntion.\nTo bridge this gap, we propose RAD-Bench for\na comprehensive evaluation of common knowledge\nsynthesis and reasoning tasks under retrieval aug-\nmented dialogues. Table 1 presents the comparison\nof our benchmark with existing ones.\n3\nRetrieval Augmented Dialogue\nBenchmark\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, each benchmark sam-\nple in RAD-Bench consists of three-turn questions\nwith accompanied retrieved context to simulate\nthe retrieval augmented dialogues. Responses to\nthe turn questions by an LLM are evaluated by a\nreference-guided-judge, and a point-wise evalua-\ntion score for the LLM is reported. In the following\nsection, we first introduce the two evaluated abili-\nties in the benchmark: Retrieval Synthesis and Re-\ntrieval Reasoning, where each ability comes with\nthree representative tasks, concluded through anal-\nysis of chat dialogues from ShareGPT (Dom Ec-\ncleston, 2024), and MediaTek DaVinci (MediaTek,\n2024). We then explain the reference-guided-judge\n\nfor evaluating LLM in generating response for re-\ntrieval augmented dialogues and the construction\npipeline of the benchmark.\n3.1\nEvaluated Abilities\nRetrieval Synthesis\nWe define Retrieval Synthesis (RS) as the ability\nof LLM in following user instructions across turns\nwhile extracting useful information from retrieved\ninformation and integrating the information pro-\ngressively. In the applications of RAG and SAG\nin chatbots (Perplexity AI, 2024; MediaTek, 2024),\nusers can require LLMs to utilize retrieved con-\ntext for answering queries related to completing\ntasks such as summarization, paragraph writing,\nand knowledge synthesis in multi-turn dialogues.\nTo measure the capability of LLMs in completing\nsuch tasks, we selected the following scenarios:\n\u2022 News TLDR (Too Long; Didn\u2019t Read) em-\nbodies the scenario of journalist writing ar-\nticles. It consists of instructions requiring\nLLMs to write comprehensive news articles\nby integrating retrievals of related past events,\nstatistics, expert opinions, and recent develop-\nments.\n\u2022 Education represents the case where educa-\ntors compose educational articles. It com-\nprises queries instructing LLMs to create en-\ngaging materials with progressive depths and\nbreadths from retrievals of diverse educational\nresources.\n\u2022 Academic Writing exemplifies the scenario\nthat researchers leveraging LLMs to draft and\nrefine sections such as related work and litera-\nture reviews for academic papers. It includes\nmulti-turn prompts that guide LLMs to inte-\ngrate retrieved information from relevant stud-\nies, data, and citations, progressively building\ncontent depth.\nRetrieval Reasoning\nWe define Retrieval Reasoning (RR), an ability of\nLLMs in adjusting responses using retrieved ref-\nerences to support logical reasoning and problem-\nsolving across multiple dialogue turns with progres-\nsive change of conditions and constraints. Reason-\ning tasks such as data analysis (MediaTek, 2024),\nconstructing customer support chatbots (Pandya\nand Holia, 2023), or planning (Xie et al., 2024)\nthrough utilizing external databases and RAG are\nprevalent scenarios for LLM applications.\nIn\nthese scenarios, users interact with LLMs through\nqueries that involve diverse hypotheses, new condi-\ntions, or changing intents based on retrieved infor-\nmation. We select scenarios where understanding\ncontext and evolving conditions is crucial for mea-\nsuring the RR ability of LLMs. These are:\n\u2022 Customer Support addresses the application\nof RAG techniques with LLMs to enhance the\nuser experience of customer support chatbots.\nIt consists of questions and retrieved contexts\nfor evaluating LLMs in resolving customer\ninquiries and narrowing down solutions with\nthe contexts as customers describe issues in\nmore details progressively.\n\u2022 Finance exemplifies the task of financial an-\nalyst utilizing LLMs with RAG to carry out\ndata analysis. Queries in this scenario include\ntasks such as comparison of assets and com-\nputing finance metrics from retrieved finan-\ncial statements for consolidating financial out-\nlooks of companies at the end of multi-turn\ndialogues.\n\u2022 Travel Planning represents the case where\nLLMs act as travel planning assistants in sug-\ngesting travel itineraries based on external\ndatabases. Instructions in such scenario start\nfrom broad questions and move on to specific\nconditions, e.g., preferred destinations, bud-\ngets, accommodations, and activities, to test\nLLMs in reasoning through conditions with\nretreived contexts. Furthermore, conflicting\nand updates to conditions are presented in the\nmulti-turn instructions to evaluate LLMs abil-\nity in correcting its advice.\n3.2\nEvaluator\nTrained with Reinforcement Learning from Hu-\nman Feedback (RLHF), LLMs have demonstrated\nstrong alignment with human preferences (Zheng\net al., 2023), achieving evaluation performance\ncomparable to human experts (Bai et al., 2024)\nwhile significantly reducing costs and improving\nscalability in model evaluation. Following Zheng\net al. (2023); Fu et al. (2023); Liu et al. (2023);\nBai et al. (2024), we utilize LLM-as-a-Judge and\nprompt the judge to evaluate chatbot responses to\nbenchmark questions. The judge takes in chat his-\ntory, retrieved context, and current turn question\n\nModel\nRAD-Bench\nType\nName\nActivated\nParams.\nContext\nLength\nAcademic\nNews\nEducation\nFinance\nCustomer\nTravel\nAverage\nClose\nGPT-4o\n-\n128k\n8.77\n8.68\n8.95\n9.00\n9.10\n7.83\n8.72\nGPT-4o-mini\n-\n128k\n8.27\n8.53\n8.80\n8.87\n8.53\n7.80\n8.47\nMistral-Large\n-\n32k\n8.17\n7.77\n8.33\n8.58\n7.83\n6.76\n7.91\nGPT-3.5-Turbo\n-\n16k\n5.30\n5.23\n6.55\n8.04\n8.47\n5.93\n6.59\nOpen\nLlama3.1-405B\n405B\n128k\n7.90\n8.07\n8.25\n8.22\n7.63\n7.21\n7.88\nLlama3.1-70B\n70B\n128k\n8.03\n7.72\n8.25\n8.02\n6.83\n7.07\n7.65\nMixtral-8x22b\n39B\n64k\n7.70\n7.47\n7.97\n8.22\n8.10\n5.79\n7.54\nDeepseek-v2\n21B\n128k\n7.57\n6.67\n8.00\n8.71\n8.27\n7.95\n7.86\nBreeXe-8x7B\n13B\n8k\n8.47\n8.14\n8.58\n7.56\n7.63\n5.74\n7.69\nMistral-Nemo-12B\n12B\n128k\n7.20\n6.84\n7.42\n7.33\n7.47\n3.55\n6.63\nLlama3.1-8B\n8B\n128k\n7.33\n6.16\n7.53\n8.33\n6.77\n5.17\n6.88\nBreeze-7B\n7B\n8k\n7.47\n7.33\n7.80\n6.93\n7.13\n4.83\n6.92\nTable 2: Evaluated models in RAD-Bench. For each scenario, bold score indicates the best open-weight model;\nunderlined score marks the best model overall. We report instruct versions of the open-weight models.\nand response as inputs and provide a point-wise\nscore to model response for each turn. Inspired by\nFu et al. (2023), we devise evaluation criteria for\njudge prompts. Each criterion is accompanied by\ntailored instructions to guide the LLM\u2019s evaluation.\nFor Retrieval Synthesis, we assess Consistency, In-\nformativeness, and Coherence, while for Retrieval\nReasoning, we evaluate Accuracy, Consistency,\nand Coherence. We implemented reference-guided\njudges (Zheng et al., 2023) with audited reference\nanswers (Appendix A.5) for each turn and adopt\nchain-of-thought to generate analysis based on the\ncriteria and the reference answer before produc-\ning the final score. For further details of the judge\nprompts and definitions of above criteria, see Ap-\npendix G.\n3.3\nBenchmark Construction\nTo construct benchmark questions with auditable\nreference answers, we propose a data generation\npipeline (Figure 4) that generates questions syn-\nthetically. This process involves deconstructing\nthe knowledge points of an article into multiple-\nturn questions for Retrieval Synthesis and break-\ning down the joint conditions of solved tasks into\nmultiple-turn questions for Retrieval Reasoning.\nWe leverage LLMs both as question generators to\ncreate a pool of synthetic candidates and as ques-\ntion scorers to select the most suitable synthetic\ncandidates for multi-turn dialogues from the re-\ntrievals. Detailed explanations of each phase are\nprovided in Appendix A.\n4\nEvaluation Results\n4.1\nEvaluation Setup\nWe evaluated a series of models, including OpenAI\nGPT (OpenAI, 2023), Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023),\nGemma (Team, 2024), Llama (Llama Team, 2024),\nDeepSeek (DeepSeek-AI, 2024), and BreeXe (Hsu\net al., 2024), each available in multiple model sizes.\nAll selected models have context windows more\nthan 8k, suitable for RAD applications. Responses\nfrom closed-source models were collected in July\n2024 and evaluated using GPT-4o (2024-05-13)\nwith temperature set to 0.\n4.2\nMain Results\nWe show scores of evaluated models in Table 2 and\nin Figure 5. Overall speaking, the closed-source\nmodels, particularly GPT-4o with average of 8.72,\nconsistently outperformed the open-source mod-\nels across most scenarios. As for the open-source\nmodels, Llama3.1-405B and Deepseek-v2 show\nstrong performance with averages of 7.88 and 7.86,\nrespectively. These two models stand out within the\nopen-source category, though still trailing behind\nthe top closed-source models.\nScenario-Specific Observations\nIn Retrieval Synthesis scenarios, BreeXe-8x-7B\nachieved impressive performance, closely rival-\ning GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o.\nThis may due\nto BreeXe-8x-7B\u2019s role as a question scorer, po-\ntentially biasing question selection towards its\nstrengths.\nAdditionally, Travel Planning sce-\nnario emerged as the most challenging, with\nDeepseek-v2 outperforming all other models, in-\n\ncluding GPT-4o. We attribute Deepseek-v2\u2019s suc-\ncess to its two-stage reinforcement learning (RL)\ntraining strategy (DeepSeek-AI, 2024), which en-\nhances reasoning capabilities through initial op-\ntimization on code and math tasks, followed by\nsafety alignment adjustments. The similarity be-\ntween travel planning and coding/math tasks in\nhypothesis formation and constraint modification\nlikely contributed to Deepseek-v2\u2019s superior per-\nformance in this scenario.\nEffect of Model Size\nFor open-source models such as Llama3.1, Mis-\ntral, and Breeze, it is evident that as the model size\nincreases, there is a notable improvement in reason-\ning capabilities, with the most significant growth\nobserved in the Travel Planning scenario. This ob-\nservation aligns with findings of Bai et al. (2024)\nand Mondorf and Plank (2024), which emphasize\nthat as model scale increases, the model\u2019s ability\nto reason, employ strategies, and interact becomes\nmore pronounced. See Figure 7 for further illus-\ntration of the performance distribution of various\nmodel series.\nFigure 3: Model performance across turns. (Top):\nRetrieval Synthesis; (Bottom) Retrieval Reasoning.\n4.3\nPerformance Across Dialogue Turns\nTo investigate model performance across turns for\ndifferent evaluated abilities, we calculate the aver-\nage score for each dialogue turn, as shown in Figure\n3. In Retrieval Synthesis, model performance gen-\nerally improves in the second turn but declines in\nthe third. After carefully reviewing evaluator judg-\nments, we attribute this to the nature of synthesis\nscenarios: second-turn questions typically extend\nthe first turn\u2019s topic. Evaluators tend to give favor-\nable scores as long as the response adheres to the\ngeneral direction established in the first turn. As for\nthe final turn, which requires summarizing diverse\nperspectives from previous rounds, presents a more\ncomplex task. For Retrieval Reasoning, scores de-\ncline with each turn. This is understandable, as\nnew conditions or constraints in subsequent turns\nrequire more complex reasoning from the model,\nresulting in lower scores.\n4.4\nCorrelation with Chatbot Arena\nTo study whether industry chat benchmark is suf-\nficient to represent the performance of LLMs in\napplications requiring augmented generations, we\ncompare the evaluation results of models in the\nbenchmark to Elo scores of models from Chat-\nbot Arena, an industry benchmark for assessing\nLLMs\u2019 chat capability (Chiang et al., 2024) through\nanonymous human evaluations. We include mod-\nels appearing in the Chatbot Arena for compari-\nson. Results in Figure 2 shows that RAD-Bench is\ndiscriminative. Models exhibiting similar level of\nchat capability, such as GPT-4o vs Llama3.1-405B;\nLlama3.1-70B vs Deepseek-v2; Llama3.1-8B vs\nMistral-Large, do not perform equally well when\nthe models are applied to scenarios with dialogues\nfrom retrieval.\n5\nConclusions and Future Work\nRAD-Bench provides significant value for industry\napplications by offering a comprehensive evalua-\ntion framework that assesses models\u2019 capabilities\nin augmented generation with retrieved context in\nmulti-turn scenarios. By assessing both Retrieval\nSynthesis and Retrieval Reasoning across six prac-\ntical scenarios inspired by human-LLM multi-turn\ndialogue interactions requiring retrieved context to\ncomplete tasks, RAD-Bench effectively differenti-\nate model performance\u2014even among LLMs with\nsimilar chat capabilities. This distinction is valu-\nable for industries deploying retrieval-augmented\n\nLLM applications, as it demonstrates that tradi-\ntional QA benchmarks and single-turn RAG bench-\nmarks often fail to capture a model\u2019s effectiveness\nin these complex scenarios. By utilizing RAD-\nBench, it helps companies optimize their model\nselection and deployment strategies, potentially\nsaving significant resources while ensuring better\nperformance in applications requiring multi-turn\nsynthesis and reasoning with retrieved context.\nIn future work, expanding the diversity of ques-\ntions and scenarios within RAD-Bench is crucial.\nWhile the current benchmark divides real-world\ndialogue into six scenarios, including a broader\nspectrum of contexts and more varied user in-\ntents, similar to the approach in Zhu et al. (2024),\ncould improve its generalizability and better chal-\nlenge models. Enhancing the evaluation method-\nology is another important direction. Averaging\nscores from multiple judge models and refining\njudge prompts through techniques such as self-\ndiscovery (Zhou et al., 2024) could lead to more\ncomprehensive assessments. Furthermore, exam-\nining potential biases in judge models under the\nRetrieval-Augmented Dialogue setting\u2014similar to\nhow Dubois et al. (2024b) identified AlpacaEval\u2019s\npreference for longer responses\u2014would improve\nconsistency in scoring from judge models.\nReferences\nGriffin Adams, Alex Fabbri, Faisal Ladhak, Eric\nLehman, and No\u00e9mie Elhadad. 2023.

RAGEval: Scenario Specific RAG Evalua-\ntion Dataset Generation Framework. arXiv preprint.\nArXiv:2408.01262 [cs].\n\nA\nDetails on the Data Generation\nA.1\nData Collection\nWe collect source articles and datasets from public\ndata to form the source documents for synthetic\nquestion generation.\nRetrieval Synthesis: For News TLDR scenario,\nwe selected news articles from BBC; for Education\nscenario, we sourced popular science paragraphs\nfrom Scientific American; for Academic Writing\nscenario, we selected related work sections from\npapers on Arxiv and further extracted papers that\nappeared in each related work section. We include\nonly source materials published after June 2024\nto reduce the likelihood of the materials being in-\ncluded in the training data of LLMs.\nRetrieval Reasoning: For Customer Support\nscenario, we collected user manuals from Many-\nManuals website. For Finance scenario, we lever-\naged datasets from FinanceBench (Islam et al.,\n2023) as source documents. The benchmark dataset\ncomprises 10,231 questions, answers, and evidence\ntriplets. The evidence triplets are passages support-\ning answering of the question from finance report\ndocuments. We manually inspected and selected\n15 triplets that involve multi-step reasoning process\nto get the final answer and collected corresponding\nsource documents to serve as base data for fur-\nther question candidate generation process. For\nTravel Planning scenario, we utilized TravelPlan-\nner dataset (Xie et al., 2024), which comprises\n1225 travel planning queries in total and leveled\nfrom simple to hard, as source documents. The\nhard questions in the dataset involved complicated\nand multiple constraints in a query, suitable for\nbeing decomposed into multi-step reasoning steps\nto construct instructions including constraints pro-\ngressively in multi-turn dialogues. We therefore\nselected 15 hard questions from the training set\nwhich provides human-annotated plan as reference\nto serve as source data for further question candi-\ndates generation process.\nA.2\nQuestion Candidate Generation\nWith the collected source documents, candidates\nof three-turn questions for each scenarios are gen-\nerated by a question generator as realized by an\nLLM. Output of the generator for News TLDR,\nEducation, Finance, and Customer Support scenar-\nios for each turn includes a question and a search\nquery. The search queries are used for retrieving\nrelevant context as discussed in Section A.3. As to\nAcademic Writing and Travel Planning scenarios,\noutputs of the generator include only the questions.\nWe craft step-by-step guidance as prompts to the\ngenerator for aligning the generated questions with\nthe evaluated abilities. See Appendix F for details\nof the guidance and the prompts. We used multiple\nLLMs (BreeXe-8x7B, Llama3-70B, and Mixtral-\n8x22B) as the generator and varied the generation\ntemperature for generating a diverse set of candi-\ndates.\nA.3\nRetrieved Context Integration\nIn this phase, each candidate\u2019s questions for each\nturn are supplemented with corresponding useful\ninformation, simulating the retrieval process. For\nthe News TLDR and Education scenarios, the ac-\ncompanied search queries as produced in the ques-\ntion candidate generation stage are passed to the\nAzure web search service to retrieve the top 5 doc-\numents as useful information. For the Customer\nSupport and Finance scenarios, we input the turn\nquestions and source documents into Azure\u2019s RAG\nservice to collect the retrieved contexts. For the\nAcademic scenario, the information to be inte-\ngrated is pre-determined. We identify referenced\npapers in the questions and extract the abstracts and\nintroductions of these papers to serve as retrieved\ncontexts for the corresponding turns. In the Travel\nPlanning scenario, each turn includes reference\ninformation from the TravelPlanner bench, such as\nflight details, cities, and attractions, without further\nmodification.\nA.4\nQuestion Candidates Selection\nWe employ an LLM as a scorer to assist the filter-\ning of question candidates. For each scenario, we\ndesign customized prompts following scoring cri-\nteria to score each candidate. The criteria include\nRelevance, Progression, Clarity, Support, Knowl-\nedge Points, and Medium Complexity as shown in\nFigure 14. The Support and Knowledge criteria\nprompt the scoring LLMs to examine whether the\nretrieved context from web search and RAG ser-\nvices contains relevant information for answering\ncandidate questions. We scored candidates with\nBreeXe-8x7B, Llama3-70B, and Mixtral-8x22B.\nAfter conducting a human review of a subsampled\nset of scored candidates, we selected the scoring\nresults from BreeXe-8x7B due to its preferable\nalignment with the established criteria. With the\nscored candidates of three-turn questions for each\nscenario, we then filtered out the top candidates\n\n1.

For evaluating scenarios in Retrieval\nSynthesis, we extract knowledge points - sets of\nfactual statements (Adams et al., 2023) - from re-\ntrieved contexts using BreeXe-8x7B as references\nfor the first and second turn questions. As to refer-\nences for the third turn, we use target paragraphs in\nsource documents. Such reference answers thereby\nprovide evaluator baseline quality of responses by\ndetermining whether useful knowledge points are\nrecalled and integrated into the model\u2019s answer.\nFor Retrieval Reasoning, which involves cross-\nturn reasoning, we manually inspect the questions\nand extract evidence text from the retrieved context\nto fully support the answers for Customer Support\nand Finance scenarios. In the Travel Planning sce-\nnario, we do not include reference answers in the\nfirst two turns. Instead, for the final turn, we use\nan expert-annotated travel plan provided in Trav-\nelPlanner Bench as the reference answer. This\nallows the evaluator to assess the similarity and\ncoverage between the model\u2019s planned itinerary\nand the expert-annotated travel plan.\nB\nLimitations\nThe primary limitation of our benchmark lies in\nthe sequential generation of questions, which may\nnot fully capture the interdependence of dialogue\nturns in real-world scenarios. In the construction of\nRAD-Bench, benchmark questions are generated\nsequentially by prompting an LLM to deconstruct\narticles or tasks into multiple-turn questions for\nRetrieval Synthesis and Retrieval Reasoning, re-\nspectively. While it allows for auditable reference\nanswers for evaluation and assesses LLMs\u2019 ability\nto handle changing user intents and additional con-\nstraints, it implicitly makes subsequent questions\nindependent of earlier answers. This design lacks\nadaptive questioning, where users engage in on-\ngoing dialogues due to dissatisfaction with initial\nLLM responses. We propose that designing follow-\nup questions based on the LLM\u2019s responses could\ncreate a tighter connection between rounds, better\nsimulating real-world chatting scenarios.\nAnother limitation of our study is that retrieved\ncontexts are pre-specified. While this design choice\nenables us to focus on the generation end to effec-\ntively evaluate how models utilize given context\nto handle changing user intents and additional re-\nquirements, it represents a constrained scenario\nwithin the broader retrieval-augmented dialogue\n\n(RAD) pipeline encountered in real-world appli-\ncations. future research aimed at benchmarking\nthe entire end-to-end RAD pipeline may provide\ninsights into potential areas for comprehensive sys-\ntem improvements.\nC\nPerformance of evaluated LLMs\nFigure 5: Performance of evaluated LLMs\nD\nEvaluated aspects and selected\napplication scenarios\nRetrieval \nScenario\n in Multi-Turn\nInteractions\nRetrieval \nSynthesis\nRetrieval \nReasoning\nAcademic\nWriting\nNews\nTLDR\nEducation\nCustomer \nSupport\nFinance\nTravel \nPlanning\nFigure 6: Evaluated capabilities\u2014Retrieval Synthesis\nand Retrieval Reasoning\u2014across three concrete appli-\ncation scenarios each.

Begin by discussing the trend of porting various\ndata structures to become GPU-resident in recent years. Explain the general approach of optimizing\nmemory layout and access patterns to fit the underlying GPU architecture. Mention some examples\nof GPU-resident indexes, such as hash tables, bloom filters, and quotient filters, and their typical\nuse cases.\nContext 1: GPU hash tables are useful for interactive graphics applications... Properties such as\nan amortized constant time complexity for insertion and querying as well as a compact memory\nlayout make them versatile associative data structures with manifold applications... More recent\napproaches including cuDF [8]...\nAssistant: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in adapting and optimizing various\ndata structures to take advantage of the massive parallelism and fast memory interfaces available on\nmodern GPUs... Hash tables, in particular, have been widely used in various applications... Several\napproaches have been proposed to accelerate hash map construction on GPUs... In summary, the\ntrend of porting various data structures to become GPU-resident has been driven by the need for\naccelerated data processing pipelines and the optimization of memory layout and access patterns to\nfit the underlying GPU architecture...\nQuestion 2: Next, expand the draft and focus on GPU-resident tree structures, such as radix trees\nand comparison-based trees. Highlight their capabilities, including range-lookup support. Mention\nthat while the evaluation includes a state-of-the-art comparison-based tree B+, no code for the radix\ntree is available.\nContext 2: Application-specific data structures, such as acceleration tree data structures used in\nray tracing [31], may also be useful for general-purpose tasks... Furthermore, B-Tree in- sertions\nare also faster than LSM and sorted array insertions...Particularly challenging is the development of\ndynamic (mu- table) data structures that can be built, queried, and updated on the GPU...\nAssistant: In the realm of GPU-resident tree structures, two main categories can be distinguished:\nradix trees and comparison-based trees... Radix trees, also known as prefix trees or Patricia tries,\nare a versatile data structure used for storing a set of strings, providing efficient lookups and range\nqueries... Comparison-based trees, such as B-trees, red-black trees, and B+ trees, are another\ntype of GPU-resident tree structure... It is important to note that while our evaluation includes a\nstate-of-the-art comparison-based tree B+, no code for the radix tree is available...\nQuestion 3: Finish the draft by discussing GPU-resident spatial indexes, such as R-Trees, and their\npotential benefits for constructing bounding volumes. Note the absence of available code for these\nindexes, which limits their use as baselines for comparisons.\nContext 3: An R-tree is a data structure for organizing and querying multi-dimensional non-\nuniform and overlapping data... R-Trees are popular spatial indexing techniques that have been\nwidely adopted in many geospatial applications...\nAssistant: In conclusion, the development of GPU-resident spatial indexes, such as R-Trees, holds\ngreat potential for accelerating various computational tasks that involve the processing of multi-\ndimensional non-uniform and overlapping data... R-Trees, in particular, have been demonstrated\nto deliver significant performance improvements when implemented on GPUs... However, it is\nimportant to note that the absence of available code for these GPU-resident indexes, such as\nR-Trees, limits their use as baselines for comparisons... As society continues to rely on geospatial\napplications and the demand for high-performance, GPU-accelerated applications grows, the\ndevelopment of efficient and adaptable GPU-resident spatial indexes is of paramount importance...\nFigure 21: Multi-turn dialogues example for Academic scenario\n\nQuestion 1: Write a detailed article about the Chicago Teachers Union\u2019s approach towards climate\nchange in their contract negotiations. The article should be approximately 3-4 paragraphs long.\nStart by explaining the background of the CTU and their previous successes in negotiating contracts.\nThen, describe Stacy Davis Gates\u2019 strategy of \u2019bargaining for the common good,\u2019 including climate\npolicies like installing solar panels and heat pumps in schools. Finally, touch upon the opposition\u2019s\nviewpoints and the potential impact of the CTU\u2019s efforts on the city and state budget.\nContext 1: The president of the Chicago Teachers Union explains how climate change became\na pillar of the union\u2019s contract demands... Stacy Davis Gates, president of the CTU since 2022,\nsees both of those strategies as pillars of winning a better contract for teachers. Climate impacts\nlike extreme heat are becoming a classroom issue... Some opponents of the union say its climate\nproposals are an example of overreach, citing Davis Gates\u2019 recent comments that the teachers\ncontract would cost the city \u201c$50 billion and three cents...\u201d\nAssistant: The Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) recently made headlines for its innovative approach\nto contract negotiations, focusing on climate change... This shift in priority is a testament to the\nunion\u2019s commitment... Under the leadership of President Stacy Davis Gates, the CTU has taken\nits mission a step further... In the case of the CTU, its climate change proposals include installing\nsolar panels and heat pumps in schools... The CTU\u2019s recent contract negotiations have put these\nproposals front and center, a move that highlights the union\u2019s determination... The CTU\u2019s previous\nsuccesses in negotiating contracts... have demonstrated its ability to influence policy and secure\nfunding for its members and communities... the CTU is setting a powerful example for other unions\nto follow, demonstrating that labor activism can and must go beyond traditional demands to address\nthe broader social and environmental issues...\nQuestion 2: Expand your previously written article by providing more details about the specific\nclimate policies proposed by the CTU. Discuss the importance of addressing climate issues within\neducational institutions and explain how implementing these policies could benefit both students\nand the wider community. Also, explore the potential challenges faced by the CTU in achieving\ntheir goals due to financial constraints and political opposition.\nContext 2: ...The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) assigns responsibility\nto Parties of the Convention to undertake educational and public awareness campaigns on climate\nchange... UNICEF has tapped into the minds and imaginations of children around the world...\nThrough its Climate Change Education for Sustainable Development programme, UNESCO aims\nto \u201chelp people understand the impact of global warming today and increase \"climate literacy\"\namong young people.\u201d This programme and other innovative educational initiatives, including the\nGlobal Action Programme (GAP)... were presented and discussed at the COP 22...\nAssistant: To expand on the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU)\u2019s approach towards climate change in\ntheir contract negotiations, it\u2019s essential to delve into the specific climate proposals put forth by\nthe union. Among the CTU\u2019s climate proposals,... By reducing the carbon footprint of schools,\nthe CTU aims to create a more sustainable and healthier learning environment for students ...\nFurthermore, incorporating climate education and awareness into the curriculum will empower the\nnext generation with the knowledge and skills to tackle climate change... One significant barrier\nis the potential financial constraints faced by the city and state budget, given the district\u2019s nearly\n$400 million deficit... In addition to financial challenges, the CTU\u2019s climate proposals have faced\npolitical opposition. Critics argue that the union\u2019s demands are an example of overreach... Despite\nthese challenges, the CTU remains committed to its climate proposals and their potential benefits\nfor students, staff, and the wider community... the CTU is leading the way in demonstrating how\nlabor unions can be instrumental in driving meaningful change...\nFigure 22: Multi-turn dialogues example for Education scenario - part 1\n\nQuestion 3: Finish your article by analyzing the broader implications of the CTU\u2019s climate-focused\nnegotiations. Consider the potential ripple effects on other labor unions, local governments, and\nthe overall push for climate action across the United States. Additionally, provide insight into the\npossible outcomes of the ongoing contract negotiations between the CTU and the city of Chicago,\ntaking into account the power dynamics and the influence of the newly elected Mayor Brandon\nJohnson.\nContext 3: ... on average, the 17 U.S. states with the highest union densities: have state minimum\nwages that are on average 19% higher than the national average and 40% higher than those in\nlow-union-density states have median annual incomes $6,000 higher than the national average have\nhigher-than-average unemployment insurance recipiency rates... Climate Action Is a Labor Issue\nfor This Teachers\u2019 Union\u2019s Leaders... The president of the Chicago Teachers Union explains how\nclimate change became a pillar of the union\u2019s contract demands... The union has already shored up\nits position by helping to elect Brandon Johnson, a former CTU organizer, as mayor of Chicago...\nOur union doubles down in a way that most unions don\u2019t. We changed our constitution to reflect\nsocial, racial and economic justice... CTU wants these talks to take place in public... This is our\nreciprocity to the communities that are already working on these issues...\nAssistant: The Chicago Teachers Union\u2019s (CTU) climate-focused negotiations represent a signif-\nicant shift in the labor movement\u2019s approach to addressing environmental concerns and climate\nchange. By prioritizing climate policies in their contract proposals, the CTU is sending a powerful\nmessage to labor unions across the country that environmental justice is an integral part of workers\u2019\nrights and well-being.\nThe potential ripple effects of the CTU\u2019s approach on other labor unions are profound. As a\nleading force in the labor movement, the CTU\u2019s actions could inspire other unions to follow\nsuit, incorporating climate policies into their contract negotiations. This could lead to a broader\npush for environmental justice and climate action within the labor sector, as unions recognize the\ninterconnected nature of labor rights and environmental sustainability.\nFurthermore, the CTU\u2019s climate-focused negotiations may also influence local governments and\npolicymakers to prioritize climate action within their communities. By demonstrating the potential\nfor positive change through contract negotiations, the CTU is providing a model for other cities\nand states to follow, highlighting the importance of addressing climate change and environmental\njustice within public policy.\nThe ongoing contract negotiations between the CTU and the city of Chicago are set against a\nbackdrop of financial constraints and political dynamics. With a nearly $400 million deficit, the\ncity faces significant challenges in meeting the CTU\u2019s demands. However, the election of Mayor\nBrandon Johnson, a former CTU organizer, may provide an opportunity for the union to secure a\nmore favorable outcome. Johnson\u2019s support for the CTU and its climate-focused negotiations could\nlead to a more collaborative approach to contract negotiations, potentially resulting in the inclusion\nof climate policies within the final agreement.\nFigure 23: Multi-turn dialogues example for Education scenario - part 2\n\nUltimately, the CTU\u2019s climate-focused negotiations may serve as a turning point for labor unions\nand environmental activism. By combining the power of organized labor with the fight for climate\naction, the CTU is demonstrating that environmental justice is not just an issue for environmentalists\nbut also a priority for the labor movement. The outcome of the ongoing contract negotiations could\nset a precedent for future labor contracts, encouraging other unions to adopt similar approaches and\npushing local governments to prioritize climate action within their communities.\nIn conclusion, the Chicago Teachers Union\u2019s climate-focused negotiations represent a significant\nturning point in the labor movement\u2019s approach to addressing climate change and environmental\njustice. By incorporating climate policies into their contract proposals, the CTU is setting a powerful\nexample for other unions and local governments to follow. As contract negotiations continue, it\nremains to be seen whether the city of Chicago will rise to the challenge and prioritize climate\naction within its public policies. However, the CTU\u2019s innovative approach to labor negotiations has\nalready made a significant impact on the labor movement and the broader fight for climate action\nacross the United States.\nFigure 24: Multi-turn dialogues example for Education scenario - part 3\n\nQuestion 1: Write an article about the challenges faced by couples in Ukraine due to ongoing\nconflict and conscription policies. The article should begin with a description of Serhiy and Tania\u2019s\nwedding experience and highlight the impact of conscription on their lives. Provide statistics\nregarding casualties and the number of police officers in Ukraine. Also, describe the experiences\nof their friends and relatives who fear being conscripted. The draft should be approximately 3-4\nparagraphs.\nContext 1: Ukrainian president signs controversial law to boost conscription to fend off Russia\u2019s\naggression... Zelensky says 31,000 troops killed since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion...\nAssistant: Title: Love Amidst War: The Struggles of Couples in Ukraine\nIn the midst of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, love and marriage have taken on new dimensions.\nThe Russia-Ukraine war, now in its third year, has not only disrupted the lives of millions but also\naltered the experiences of couples trying to get married amidst the chaos... Serhiy, a 27-year-old IT\nprofessional, and Tania, a 25-year-old teacher, had been planning their wedding for months...For\nSerhiy and Tania, the decision to marry was not taken lightly. Their friends and family members,\nmany of whom have lost loved ones in the conflict or have been directly affected by the ongoing\nwar... In spite of the challenges, love and hope continue to persevere in Ukraine. Serhiy and Tania,\nalong with countless other couples, are determined to build a life together in the face of adversity.\nQuestion 2: Continue the article by exploring the reasons behind the reluctance of Ukrainian\ncitizens to join the military despite the ongoing conflict. Discuss the imbalance between the\nnumber of police officers and the general population, and provide perspectives from individuals\nlike Maksym who choose not to participate in the fighting. Additionally, explain the consequences\nof evading conscription and the measures taken by authorities to enforce compliance. The draft\nshould be approximately 2-3 paragraphs.\nContext 2: ... We first saw millions of Ukrainians flee the country when the Russians invaded\nUkraine in February this year. Now there are reports of hundreds of thousands of Russians fleeing\ntheir country in order to avoid Russia\u2019s first mobilisation since the second world war... Racism,\nreligious discrimination and homophobia are endemic to the Russian military, resulting in targeted\nmistreatment...\nAssistant: The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has taken a heavy toll on the country\u2019s population,\nwith millions of people displaced and thousands killed... Firstly, the fear of death or injury is a\nsignificant factor that deters many Ukrainians from entering the military...
